# 📚 Library Management System using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview

**Project Title:** Library Management System  
**Level:** Intermediate  
**Database Name:** `library_db`  

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. It includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced SQL queries. The goal is to showcase skills in database design, manipulation, and querying.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Set up the Library Management System Database**  
  Create and populate tables for:
  - Branches  
  - Employees  
  - Members  
  - Books  
  - Issued Status  
  - Return Status  

- **CRUD Operations**  
  Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.

- **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**  
  Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.

- **Advanced SQL Queries**  
  Develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.

  Created a database named `library_db`.

- **Table Creation:**  
  Created tables for:
  - `branches` – Information about different library branches
  - `employees` – Employee details and their associated branches
  - `members` – Library members and their contact info
  - `books` – Books available in the library
  - `issued_status` – Books issued to members
  - `return_status` – Details about returned books

Each table includes relevant columns, relationships, and constraints to ensure data integrity.
